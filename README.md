In this SBA assignment I used a simple API to fetch data using axios of countries and their 
values, such as the capital, population, language, currency, region, continent and coat of arms.

The API searches for random countries when clicking the button


URL of the API https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all

This API did not require any API key or Tokens

used multiple design implementing

created another JS file "fetch.js" as a ready base function to check out other APIs 
the and to exports data
